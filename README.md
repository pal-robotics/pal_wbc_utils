##  PAL Whole Body Control

The PAL Whole Body Control (WBC) is PALâ€™s implementation of the Stack of Tasks<sup>[1](http://homepages.laas.fr/ostasse/mansard_icar09.pdf)</sup>. It includes a hierarchical
quadratic solver, running at 100 Hz, able to accomplish different tasks with different priorities assigned to each. In order to accomplish the tasks, the WBC can take control of all the joints of the robot.

When WBC starts a predefined stack with a set of task is started. By default in all the robots the set of task includes (from highest to lowest priority):
- Joint limit avoidance: to ensure joint limits are never reached.
- Foot consrtaints (only humanoids): for the non-fixed base robots, it constraints the feet to the actual pose.
- Stabilizer (only humanoids): fix the center of mass between both feet.
- Self-collision avoidance: to prevent the robot from colliding with itself while moving.

Those tasks are automatically managed by the WBC, and should be always active with the highest priority. Not using them may be potentially dangerous for the robot because it could damage itself.

Then the user may push new tasks, for example to move the end-effectors to any spatial configuration and/or make the robot look to any spatial point. These goals can be changed dynamically as we will see in the following subsection. Moreover other kind of tasks, such as set a default configuration in joint space, or control the robot using admittance control can be pushed.

The difference between using WBC and other inverse kinematic solvers is that the WBC finds online solutions,
automatically prevent self-collisions and ensure joint limit avoidance.

This is the list of packages related with WBC.

Some of the tasks present in the wbc_tasks are a proof of concept, or have been deprecated or upgraded in a new task.

## Create Tasks

There are two different ways to configure and push a task in the stack:

- Creating a specific stack and loading it when WBC starts
- Pushing it online from the Property Bag

### Create a specific stack

The stack is the set of tasks pushed and configured once the controller starts.

If the user wants to start the WBC with a specific stack of tasks, it could create his own stack in order to start the controller with the given stack.

1. First of all it will be necessary to create the stack and export it as a plugin. 

2. Once the stack is created it will be necessary to define it in the specific config file that the controller loads:
```sh
type: pal_wbc/WholeBodyControlKinematicController

dt: 0.005
floating_base: XYZ_Quaternion
formulation: velocity
stack_configuration: talos_stack_both_hands_head
solver_type: QpReductionuEqualitiesQuadprogHeapAllocation

use_stabilizer: true
use_admitance: false
use_home_posture: true
initialize_bfp_tf: false
use_odom: false

robot_model_chains:
  [gripper_left_base_link,
   gripper_right_base_link,
   left_sole_link,
   right_sole_link,
   rgbd_rgb_optical_frame]

...
```
The stack configuration param defines the name of the stack that the controller will load. In the previous example the **talos_stack_both_hands_head** is gonna be loaded.

3. Finally is necessary to load the parameters and launch the WBC controller.
```sh

<launch>

  <arg name="ns" default="whole_body_kinematic_controller"/>

 <rosparam command="load"
    file="$(find talos_wbc)/config/kinematic/talos_stack_both_hands_head.yaml" ns="$(arg ns)"/>

 <node name="wbc_controllers_spawner" pkg="controller_manager" type="spawner" output="screen" args="$(arg ns)" />

</launch>
```

This is just a code example. Please check the handbook in order to see with detaill how WBC is launched.

Once the controller starts the stack will be loaded and the tasks with start.

> Note: All the classes have their own related struct that contains the necessary parameters to configure the task. 

> Note: All the tasks can be configured from the SetUpTask passing as an argument the struct with the parameters. Although some of the tasks described before are helpers which already configure the tasks in the constructor. By default only the tasks with an empty constructor should be configured from the SetUpTask function.

### Configure a task from Property Bag

Once the stack is created new tasks can be pushed and removed from the stack by a service call.

Those tasks that can be loaded online need to be exported as a plugin. In the list of stacks above is specified which ones can be load from the Property Bag.

In order to create and push a task from property bag is necessary:

1. The given task has the configureConstraintsFromPropertyBag method implemented

2. Export the task as a pal_wbc plugin:

 2.1 Create a cpp file with all the plugins. Example wbc_task_plugins.cpp
```sh
#include <wbc_tasks/go_to_kinematic_task.h>
PLUGINLIB_EXPORT_CLASS(pal_wbc::GoToPositionMetaTask, pal_wbc::TaskAbstract);
```
 2.2 Add it in your CMakeLists project
```sh
add_library(plugins src/wbc_tasks_plugins.cpp)
target_link_libraries(my_wbc_plugins ${catkin_LIBRARIES})

...

install(TARGETS my_wbc_plugins
   ARCHIVE DESTINATION ${CATKIN_PACKAGE_LIB_DESTINATION}
   LIBRARY DESTINATION ${CATKIN_PACKAGE_LIB_DESTINATION}
   RUNTIME DESTINATION ${CATKIN_PACKAGE_BIN_DESTINATION}
)
```
2.3 Create a plugin file that exports all of them as a library. Example my_wbc_plugins.xml
```sh
<library path="lib/libmy_wbc_plugins">

  <class name="pal_wbc/GoToPositionMetaTask" type="pal_wbc::GoToPositionMetaTask" base_class_type="pal_wbc::TaskAbstract">
    <description>
      GoToPositionMetaTask task
    </description>
  </class>

</library>
```
2.4 Export the my_wbc_plugins_xml file in your package.xml
```sh
<export>
     <pal_wbc_controller plugin="${prefix}/my_wbc_plugins.xml" />
</export>
```
3. Push the task in the stack

**It is very dangerous to stop and restart Whole Body Controller in ROS control, without previously unloading and reloading it. Because it will
start with the previous stack at the moment it was stopped. Creating a discontinuity in most of the joints and a very abrupt motion.
Also, remember that all the tasks pushed online will be lost the next time the WBC is loaded and started.**

> Note: See [pluginlib](http://wiki.ros.org/pluginlib) documentation to learn with more detaill how plugins are created and exported.

### Push / Remove tasks from the stack

There are two ways of push and remove tasks from the stack once the controller is loaded.

1. By using the WBC Service Helper class.
2. Using the WBC rosservices

- Prints the stack description
```sh
$ rosservice call /whole_body_kinematic_controller/get_stack_description "{}"
```
- Removes a specific task from the stack
```sh
$ rosservice call /whole_body_kinematic_controller/pop_task "name: 'task_id'
blend: false
blending_duration:
  data:
    secs: 0
    nsecs: 0"
```
- Get the task error of a specific task
```sh
$ rosservice call /whole_body_kinematic_controller/get_task_error "id: 'task_id'"
```
- Pushes a new task in the stack
```sh
$ rosservice call /whole_body_kinematic_controller/push_task "push_task_params:
  params: ''
  respect_task_id: ''
  order: {order: 0}
  blend: false
  blending_duration:
    data: {secs: 0, nsecs: 0}" 

```
The params contain the list of params for the property to be configured. The respect_task_id is the id of the task which the new task is pushed respect to, and the order corresponds to how the task
is pushed (before, after, same, replace).This method is not recomended because manually passing the parameters is extremely error prone.

The best way to do it is creating a node that pushes the desired tasks in the stack. As stated in the previous section, this package contains many nodes that push the most common tasks
in the stack.


> Note: In fact the WBC Service Helper class is a wrapper that uses the rosservices to push and pop the different tasks.

> Note: The blend parameter allows to push and remove tasks interpolating from the current position of the robot which will reduce discontinuities and smooth things. Although still under development.

> attention Don't remove tasks such as self_collision, joint_limits, foot_constraints... Removing this tasks may be potentially dangerous for the robot.

## Examples

#### Push Gaze task

The push_interactive_marker_gaze_task node pushes a **GoToPointRayAngleGazeKinematicMetatask** in the stack.

This task allows the robot to look at a certain point in the space.

Some of the node properties are readed as a rosparam and could be modified.

Property name | Type |  Description | Default
------------- | ---- | ------------ | -------
source_data | std::string | Reference type. Defines how the target pose is specified (topic, pointer, interactive_marker). | interactive_marker |
camera_frame | std::string | Name of the camera frame. The camera frame has to be one of the optical frames. | xtion_optical_frame |
respect_task_id | std::string | The gaze_task is gonna be pushed after this specific task in the stack. | self_collision |
ns | std::string | Controller namespace. | /whole_body_kinematic_controller

#### Push Pose task

The push_interactive_marker_pose_task node pushes a task to control in position and orientation a specific link of the robot.

First it pushes a **GoToPositionMetaTask** / **GoToLocalVirtualAdmitancePositionMetaTask** task to control the position. And after this task it pushes a 
**GoToOrientationMetaTask** / **GoToLocalVirtualAdmitanceOrientationMetaTask** task to control the orientation.

Some of his properties are readed as a rosparam at could be modified.

Property name | Type |  Description | Default
------------- | ---- | ------------ | -------
source_data | std::string | Reference type. Defines how the target position is controlled (topic, pointer, interactive_marker). | interactive_marker_reflexx_typeII |
reference_frame | std::string | If source_data is pointer / pointer_reflexx_typeII, the reference frame is the frame for the reference | base_link. In the humanoids this param should be odom |
target_position | geometry_msgs::PointStamped | If source_data is pointer / pointer_reflexx_typeII, this param represents the target_position | This param is mandatory |
target_orientation | geometry_msgs::QuaternionStamped | If source_data is pointer / pointer_reflexx_typeII, this param represents the target_orientation | This param is mandatory |
tip_name | std::string | Controlled link name. | arm_tool_link |
respect_task_id | std::string | The position task is gonna be pushed after this specific task in the stack. | self_collision |
ns | std::string | Controller namespace. | /whole_body_kinematic_controller
damping | double | Damping to avoid local minima. | By default is set to 0.2
admitance_ft | std::string | FT name related to the controlled link. If ft name specified, it uses admitance control | By default is empty

> warning If the damping parameter is set to zero, the robot will start vibrating.

> Note: If admitance_ft the tasks pushed are of type **GoToLocalVirtualAdmitancePositionMetaTask** and **GoToLocalVirtualAdmitanceOrientationMetaTask**. Otherwise it pushes **GoToPositionMetaTask** and **GoToOrientationMetaTask**.

#### Push Relative task

The push_interactive_marker_relative_task node pushes relative task that constrains a link respect another one.

First it pushes a task to control a speficfic link in position and orientation. If a ft is specified this link is controlled via admittance control.

Then it pushes a relative task that constraints another link (slave) respect the controlled link (master).

This implies that the user control one link, but another link moves at the same time to keeps his position and orientation respect the controlled link.

Property name | Type |  Description | Default
------------- | ---- | ------------ | -------
source_data | std::string | Reference type. Defines how the master link is controlled (topic, pointer, interactive_marker). | interactive_marker_reflexx_typeII |
tip_name | std::string | Controlled link / Master link | arm_left_tool_link |
constrained_link | std::string | Constrained link / Slave link from the relative task | arm_right_tool_link |
respect_task_id | std::string | The position task is gonna be pushed after this specific task in the stack. | self_collision |
ns | std::string | Controller namespace. | /whole_body_kinematic_controller |
admitance_ft | std::string | FT name related to the controlled link. If ft name specified, it uses admitance control | By default is empty |
target_position | geometry_msgs::PointStamped | Relative position constraint from the master link to the constrained link | This param is mandatory |
target_orientation | geometry_msgs::QuaternionStamped | Relative orientation constraint from the master link to the constrained link | This param is mandatory

#### Push Torso height task

The push_torso_height_ref node pushes position task that constraints the torso at a specific height.

It pushes a postion task with some extra properties that constraint the Z coordinate of the torso frame at a specific height wich respect the base frame.

Property name | Type |  Description | Default
------------- | ---- | ------------ | -------
link_name | std::string | Link to be contrained | torso_1_link 1
base_frame | std::string | Reference link which respect the height is specified | odom |
reference_height | double | Height  | 0.0 |
ns | std::string | Controller namespace. | /whole_body_kinematic_controller |
before_task_id | std::string | The position task is gonna be pushed before this specific task in the stack. | default_reference

#### Push Reference task

The push_topic_reference_task node pushes a reference task that could be modified by topic.

> attention If the reference configuration when pushing the task is ifferent than the default one, a discontinuity will arise, that will make the robot "jump" from one configuration to another one.

Property name | Type |  Description | Default
------------- | ---- | ------------ | -------
source_data | std::string | Reference type. Defines how the reference configuration is defined (vector_topic, vector_pointer). | vector_topic |
topic_name | std::string | Name of the topic where the new configurations needs to be published | "/whole_body_kinematic_controller/vector_topic" |
position_gain | double | Position gain to reduce the position error in the task | 3.0 |
joint_names | std::vector<std::string> | Joint names controlled by the reference  | The head, torso and arm joint names |
ns | std::string | Controller namespace. | /whole_body_kinematic_controller |
reference | std::vector<double> | Reference configuration | Reads the default configuration of the WBC |
respect_task_id | std::string | The reference task is gonna be pushed replacing this specific task in the stack. | default_reference

### References

In order to specify either a position, a orientation or a pose in cartesian space to command a specific link of the robot or make it look to a specific point, a reference is required.

The references allows to store a desired pose, velocity and acceleration. Then the whole body controller requires it in every update loop to calculate the error in terms of position, orientation, velocity and acceleration.

There are many kind of references that use different ways to set the target pose dynamically. Moreover there are references that store a set of position, velocities and accelerations for a set of joints to specify a specific configuration for the robot.


### WBC Service helper

One of the main utilities of this package is the [WBCServiceHelper](./classpal_1_1WBCServiceHelper.html) class that allows to:

- push a task in the stack
- remove a task from the stack
- check if a task exists in the stack
- get task error to the target objective
- print the stack description
- wait until a certain task has converged to a specific tolerance

> Note: Remember that only those tasks which are exported as a plugin can be pushed on the stack once the controller already started.

Example of how a task is pushed:
```sh
int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
  ros::init(argc, argv, "push_pose_task");
  ros::NodeHandle nh("~");

  std::string ns;
  nh.param<std::string>("ns", ns, "/whole_body_kinematic_controller");
  pal::WBCServiceHelper srv_helper(nh, ns);

  ...

  property_bag::PropertyBag task;
  task.addProperty("taskType", std::string("pal_wbc/GoToPositionMetaTask"));
  task.addProperty("task_id", std::string("position_" + tip_name));
  task.addProperty("signal_reference", reference_type);
  task.addProperty("tip_name", tip_name);
  task.addProperty("damping", damping);

  ...

  std::string previous_task_id;
  nh.param<std::string>("respect_task_id", previous_task_id, "self_collision");
  pal_wbc_msgs::Order::_order_type order = pal_wbc_msgs::Order::After;

  if (!srv_helper.pushTask(task, std::string("position_" + tip_name), order, previous_task_id))
  {
    ROS_ERROR_STREAM("problem pushing position task");
  }

  ...

```
